# Library Development Guidelines

Guidelines for developing reusable Go libraries and packages.

## Public API Design
- All exported functions and types must have comprehensive documentation
- Use semantic versioning for releases (v1.2.3)
- Maintain backward compatibility within major versions
- Provide usage examples in documentation and README
- Keep the public API as small and focused as possible
- Use interfaces to define contracts

## Documentation
- Document all exported functions, types, constants, and variables
- Provide package-level documentation explaining the purpose
- Include examples in documentation comments
- Write comprehensive README with usage examples
- Document error conditions and return values
- Use godoc conventions for formatting

## Error Handling
- Define custom error types for different error categories
- Provide error wrapping for context
- Include helpful error messages for debugging
- Document all possible error conditions
- Use sentinel errors for specific error cases
- Implement error chains for nested errors

## API Stability
- Never change existing function signatures without major version bump
- Mark deprecated functions with deprecation comments
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes
- Use build tags for experimental features
- Version your APIs appropriately
- Maintain changelog for all releases

## Testing
- Maintain minimum 80% test coverage
- Write table-driven tests where appropriate
- Include benchmark tests for performance-critical code
- Test all public API functions
- Test error conditions thoroughly
- Use property-based testing for complex logic

## Performance
- Profile performance-critical paths
- Provide benchmarks for performance claims
- Avoid unnecessary allocations
- Use efficient algorithms and data structures
- Document performance characteristics
- Provide configuration options for performance tuning

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Pin dependency versions
- Regular security updates for dependencies
- Document all dependencies and their purposes
- Consider vendoring critical dependencies
- Use go.mod for dependency management

## Configuration
- Use functional options pattern for complex configuration
- Provide sensible defaults
- Make configuration immutable after creation
- Validate configuration at initialization
- Document all configuration options
- Use builder pattern for complex objects

## Concurrency
- Make types safe for concurrent use or document thread safety
- Use channels for communication between goroutines
- Provide context support for cancellation
- Document goroutine lifecycle
- Use sync.Pool for expensive object reuse
- Implement proper cleanup mechanisms

## Resource Management
- Implement proper cleanup (Close() methods)
- Use defer for resource cleanup
- Provide context-aware operations
- Implement proper timeout handling
- Use finalizers only when necessary
- Document resource ownership

## Packaging
- Use meaningful package names
- Keep packages focused on single responsibility
- Avoid circular dependencies
- Use internal packages for implementation details
- Organize code in logical package structure
- Follow Go package naming conventions

## Versioning & Releases
- Use semantic versioning
- Tag releases in Git
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Write migration guides for major versions
- Use go.mod for module versioning
- Document breaking changes clearly

## Code Quality
- Use gofmt, golint, and go vet
- Follow Go Code Review Comments
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid global state
- Use interfaces for testability

## Examples & Documentation
- Provide runnable examples
- Include examples in godoc
- Write comprehensive README
- Provide getting started guide
- Document common use cases
- Include troubleshooting section
